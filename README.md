> Production-grade MLOps system deploying an object detection model using Docker, Terraform, AWS ECS (Fargate), and CI/CD with full HTTPS support.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a **real-world MLOps workflow**, taking a machine learning model from:

**Local Development → Containerisation → Cloud Deployment → Infrastructure as Code → CI/CD Automation**

Unlike traditional ML projects, this focuses on **deployment, scalability, and production readiness**.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- YOLOv8 object detection API  
- Full-stack application (Frontend + Flask backend)  
- Dockerised services (production-ready)  
- AWS ECS (Fargate) deployment  
- HTTPS with custom domain (Route53 + ACM)  
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform  
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions  
- Health checks and automated deployments

## 🖥️ Application
Backend (Flask API)
- Health → Service health check
- Predict → Object detection endpoint
- Loads YOLOv8 model (yolov8n.pt)
- Returns:
- Bounding boxes
- Labels
- Confidence scores


Frontend
- Image upload interface
- Sends requests to /predict
- Displays detection results

🐳 Containerisation
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Non-root user for security
- Lightweight base images
- Separate frontend/backend services


## 📦 Container Registry (ECR)

- Images are stored in Amazon ECR.

docker tag yolov8-backend:latest <ecr-repo>:tag
docker push <ecr-repo>:tag

## ☁️ Deployment (AWS ECS - Fargate)
- Services Used
- ECS (Fargate)
- ECR
- Application Load Balancer
- Route53
- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- IAM
- VPC


## 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

All AWS infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform.


## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

Implemented using GitHub Actions.

- Pipeline Stages
- Build Docker images
- Push images to ECR
- Deploy infrastructure (Terraform)
- Update ECS service
- Run health checks
